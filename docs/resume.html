            <h3>Experience</h3>
            <p>May 2019 - Present</p>
            <p>[ Lifeguard | Presque Isle State Park]</p>
            <p>During my time as a lifeguard at Presque Isle I have had many responsibilities. I observe people in the 
                water and on the beach in order to keep them safe and enforce park rules. I have saved a young child 
                from drowning and performed first aid several times. I was also certified as a first responder</p>
            <h3>Education</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Iroquois High School, Erie, PA</li>
                <li> Penn State Behrend, Erie, PA</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Leadership/ Communication</h3>
            <p>Throughout life I have been involved in several organizations and teams. In high school I was in the 
                National Honors Society as well as the varsity swim team for all 4 years. I was also in the marching 
                band as a section leader. As a lifeguard I communicate with dozens of people a day and seek 
                compliance with park rules. Now I am a member of the Penn State Behrend swim team.</p>
