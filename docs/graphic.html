            <p>while creating both websites I found the processes very interesting. If comparing difficulty, I believe coding on Github with HTML was more of a challenge.
            There was definitely a large learning curve when it came to getting used to HTML and all of the various rules that one must memorize in order to have a functioning code.
            Wordpress was much easier to get used to because it gives users templates and clearly explained options that can be selected to make a website.
            In addition, styling websites is much more difficult on Github using HTML and CSS because there are so many specific rules to remember. Wordpress does a very good job of creating customized
            styling options to create websites that look great for anything a user would need it for. While Github and HTML coding was more difficult in almost all categories, I felt a great sense of satisfaction when I
            got my code to function correctly after so much work and learning. There was not much of a learnong curve with wordpress. After a brief introduction, I found everything to be decently self-explanatory.
            Here is <a href="https://sites.psu.edu/jaxabele/">my Wordpress site</a> that has the exact same content as this site, but created solely on Wordpress. You may see some differences!
