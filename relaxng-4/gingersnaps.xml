<title>Gingersnaps</title>

<desc>These crunchy, spicy rounds with their cracked, sugary tops are equally at home dunked in tea, coffee, or milk, and frequently enjoyed during the November/December holiday season. But they're just as welcome on a mellow, golden, late-September afternoon, with a comfortable lounge chair and a large glass of fresh-squeezed lemonade.</desc>

<instructions>Instructions

<step n='1'>Preheat the oven to 375Â°F. Lightly grease (or line with parchment) two baking sheets.</step>

<step n='2'>Beat together the <ingred id='shortening'>shortening</ingred>, <ingred id='sugar'>sugar</ingred>, <ingred id='salt'>salt</ingred>, and <ingred id='soda'>baking soda</ingred>.</step>

<step n='3'>Beat in the <ingred id='egg'>egg</ingred>, then the <ingred id='molasses'>molasses</ingred>.</step>

<step n='4'>Add the <ingred id='flour'>flour</ingred> and <ingred id='ginger' id='cloves' id='cinnamon'>spices</ingred>, beating to make a smooth, fairly stiff dough.</step>

<step n='5'>To make the coating, combine the <ingred id='sugar'>sugar</ingred> and <ingred id='cinnamon'>cinnamon</ingred>, and place in a shallow pan or dish.</step>

<step n='6'>Drop the dough in 1" balls into the <ingred id='cinnamon'>cinnamon</ingred>-<ingred id='sugar'>sugar</ingred> mixture; a teaspoon cookie scoop is perfect here.</step>

<step n='7'>Roll the balls in the <ingred id='sugar'>sugar</ingred> to coat, then transfer them to the prepared baking sheets, leaving at least 1 1/2" between them; they'll spread as they bake.</step>

<step n='8'>Bake the cookies for 11 minutes, for cookies that are crisp around the edges, and "bendy" in the center. Bake for 13 minutes, for cookies that are crisp/crunchy all the way through.</step>

<step n='9'>Remove the cookies from the oven, and cool right on the pan, or on a rack. Cool completely, then store tightly wrapped, at room temperature.</step></instructions>
